# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize has given myself and Omar a brand-new assignment. We created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Purpose
Purpose of this report is to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 


## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.8, Visual Studio Code, 1.46.1
